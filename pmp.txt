Now that you understand StatDGA.py

Lets do these steps on the the figures
first for all the figures inrease the font of the text in the axises and make the text bold and readble

then also make a plot for
4.5 Distribution Analysis

FIGURE
Gas concentration distributions follow characteristic patterns expected in DGA data, with log-normal characteristics enabling appropriate statistical modeling approaches. The preservation of complete data ranges ensures representation of both normal operating conditions and fault signatures essential for diagnostic algorithm development.
